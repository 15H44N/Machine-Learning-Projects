Recently I've commented on several threads (namely, the ones focused on the recent Secret Sessions) inquiring about her upcoming album and how it's sound will compare to her previous albums. I saw a thread arguing about what genre Red falls under, which.. is a harder question to answer than I thought it would be. Today I decided to research all of her previous albums and make a comprehensive break-down of what songs fall into what genres for her. Is Taylor Swift a country star first and foremost, or has her discography become predominantly pop..? Let's find out. **Disclaimer: To stop the list from getting too long, if a song had more than one genre I picked whichever one fit the track best.
